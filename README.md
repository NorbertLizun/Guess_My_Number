Guess My Number is a simple number guessing game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The player tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. After each guess, the game provides
feedback â€” whether the guess was too high,too low, or correct. The score decreases with each wrong
attempt, and the game tracks the highest score achieved. The player can reset thegame anytime
using the "Again!" button.
